# V-Scanner folder config file
#
# This file contains instructions for the Win500 Virtual Scanner 
# function. It is used to perform "batch" operations on the PSR-500's
# V-Scanner folders.
#
# Any line that begins with '#' (like this line) is a comment and is
# ignored.
# Any blank line (like the following line) is ignored

# After ignoring comments and blank lines, the remaining lines are
# interpreted as instructions for each of the V-Scanner folders, 00
# through 20. You can perform "clear", "read", and "Write" operations
# on each folder:
# * If a line contains only "<empty>" or "<clear>", the corresponding
#   V-Folder will be erased.
# * If a line contains only "<read>", the corresponding V-Folder will
#   be read into Win500, similar to when you download data from the 
#   scanner's working memory.
# * Any other text is interpreted as the pathname of a P500 or BIN
#   file. Win500 will attempt to open and read that file, and will
#   send it to the corresponding V-Folder.
